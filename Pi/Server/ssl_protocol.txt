Each command consists of four bytes (e.g. 01A58E74). The first byte contains 
the function; the last three contain arguments.

To Raspberry Pi:
=====================
Byte code   Function
---------------------
00          Error. Argument is ID of error.

XX          Move to pixel. Argument is the pixel number, counting left and then
            down from 0 in the top left corner.
            
XX          Move to altitude. Argument is altitude in 1/100 degrees.
            
XX          Move to azimuth. Argument is azimuth in 1/100 degrees.
            
XX          Move to saved location. Argument is ID of saved location.

XX          Set safety. First bit of argument determines on (1) or off (0);
            further bits are irrelevant.
            
XX          Fire. Argument is irrelevant.
            
XX          Move reticle. Argument is the pixel number, counting left and then
            down from 0 in the top left corner.
            
XX          Store new saved location. Argument is irrelevant.
            
XX          Request reticle position. Argument is irrelevant.
            
XX          Request altitude/azimuth. Argument is irrelevant.

XX          Request safety position. Argument is irrelevant.

XX          Request list of saved locations. Argument is irrelevant.


To iOS:
=====================
Byte code   Function
---------------------
00          Error. Argument is ID of error.

XX          Return reticle position. Argument is the pixel number, counting 
            left and then down from 0 in the top left corner.
            
XX          Return altitude. Argument is altitude in 1/100 degrees.
            
XX          Return azimuth. Argument is azimuth in 1/100 degrees.
            
XX          Return safety position. First bit indicates on (1) or off (0); 
            further bits are irrelevant.
            
XX          Begin list of saved locations. Argument is number of saved          # Going to need special protocol for this.
            locations.
