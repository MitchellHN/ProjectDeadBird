Connecting:
=====================

Connection has two parts. First, the Raspberry Pi listens on the data socket
and the UI connects. Then, the UI listens on a camera port and sends a port 
number while the Raspberry Pi connects. At this point, the Raspberry Pi will
begin transmitting video and either side can send commands.


Commands:
=====================

Each command consists of four bytes (e.g. 01A58E74). The first byte contains 
the function; the last three contain arguments. All arguments have big
endianness, i.e. the first bit is the most significant.

To Raspberry Pi:
=====================
Hex code    Function
---------------------
00          Error. Argument is ID of error.

--Movement

10          Move to pixel. Argument is the pixel number, counting left and then
            down from 0 in the top left corner. Unsigned
            
11          Move to altitude. Argument is altitude in 1/100 degrees. Unsigned

12          Change altitude. Argument is change in 1/100 degrees, signed with
            two's complement.

13          Move to azimuth. Argument is azimuth from most counter-clockwise
            direction in 1/100 degrees. Unsigned
            
14          Change azimuth. Argument is change in 1/100 degrees, signed with
            two's complement. Positive is clockwise, negative is counter.
            
15          Move to saved location. Argument is ID of saved location.

16          Set safety. First bit of argument determines on (1) or off (0);
            further bits are irrelevant.
            
17          Fire. Argument is irrelevant.

--Alter internal variables
            
30          Move reticle. Argument is the pixel number, counting left and then
            down from 0 in the top left corner. Unsigned.
            
31          Store new saved location. Argument is irrelevant.

--Request data
            
50          Request reticle position. Argument is irrelevant.
            
51          Request altitude. Argument is irrelevant.

52          Request azimuth. Arguement is irrelevant.

53          Request safety position. Argument is irrelevant.

54          Request list of saved locations. Argument is irrelevant.


To UI:
=====================
Byte code   Function
---------------------
00          Error. Argument is ID of error.

--Data return

10          Return reticle position. Argument is the pixel number, counting 
            left and then down from 0 in the top left corner. Unsigned
            
11          Return altitude. Argument is altitude in 1/100 degrees. Unsigned
            
12          Return azimuth. Argument is azimuth in 1/100 degrees. Unsigned.
            
13          Return safety position. First bit indicates on (1) or off (0); 
            further bits are irrelevant.
            
14          Begin list of saved locations. Argument is number of saved          # Going to need special protocol for this.
            locations. Unsigned.
